    '5 Common Mistakes That Delay Your e-Passport',
    'Avoid these frequent errors that push back e-Passport processing by weeks.',
    E'Applying for an e-Passport is straightforward on paper, but small mistakes can add weeks to your wait. Here are the most common ones:\n\n1. Mismatched name spelling — Your name on the passport application must exactly match your NID or birth certificate. Even a missing middle initial can trigger a rejection.\n\n2. Wrong address details — Use your NID address unless you have valid proof of a new address (utility bill, rental agreement). Inconsistent addresses commonly trigger extra police verification.\n\n3. Skipping the appointment slot — Walking in without a booked appointment often means a longer wait or being turned away. Always book through the portal first.\n\n4. Incomplete online payment — If your payment doesn''t reflect in the system before your appointment, your file won''t be processed. Keep your payment slip and confirmation SMS as proof.\n\n5. Not tracking application status — Passports needing police verification can sit idle if you don''t follow up. Check your status online regularly and contact the regional office if there''s no movement after 3 weeks.\n\nPlanning ahead and double-checking your documents against your NID before you submit can save you a lot of back-and-forth.',

    E'Official timelines and real-world experience don''t always match. Here''s a general sense of what to expect for the services covered on ShebaPath:\n\n- Driving Licence: The test itself can be booked within a couple of weeks, but the physical smart card often takes 30–45 days to arrive after you pass.\n\n- e-Passport: Regular delivery is usually 15–21 working days if no police verification is needed. If verification is triggered, add another 2–4 weeks.\n\n- NID Correction: Straightforward corrections (like a spelling fix) typically clear in about a month. Corrections involving date of birth or more significant edits can take longer and sometimes require in-person verification.\n\n- Birth Certificate: The fastest of the group — usually 3–7 days once your printed form and documents are submitted to your local registrar.\n\n- Trade License: General and commercial licenses are often issued within 1–2 weeks. Manufacturing licenses requiring a fire/environmental inspection can take up to a month.\n\nA good rule of thumb: apply well ahead of any deadline (travel, school admission, business launch), and always keep your payment receipts and application numbers so you can follow up if something stalls.',
